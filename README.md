# Optics
Optics simulations using the LightPipes optical toolbox are written in Jupyter notebooks. Students can open the notebook, read some introduction about the topic and perform exercises. The simulations can be used as an introduction to real optical experiments in the lab.

The following notebooks are available:
## Physical Optics

1. [spherical_wavefront.ipynb](./PhysicalOptics/spherical_wavefront.ipynb) A **spherical wavefront** is produced by illuminating a small hole with a monochromatic, plane wave. The student investigates the inverse quadratic law by measuring, with the mouse, the intensity at the centre of the beam at several distances from the hole.
2. [ReflectRefract.ipynb](./PhysicalOptics/ReflectRefract.ipynb) **Internal reflection and refraction** is studied. A linear polarized laser beam enters a glass and is internally reflected and refracted. The polarization and the angle of incidence can be varied.
3. [TwoHoles.ipynb](./PhysicalOptics/TwoHoles.ipynb) **Young's experiment**. A plane monochromatic wave illuminates a screen with two small holes. The resulting interference pattern behind the screen can be studied.
4. [NewtonRings.ipynb](./PhysicalOptics/NewtonRings.ipynb) **Newton rings** can be observed when light falls on a convex lens laying on a flat glass plate. The effect of a transparent medium between them can be studied.
5. [FabryPerot.ipynb](./PhysicalOptics/FabryPerot.ipynb) The **Fabry Perot** interferometer is studied in this assignment. By changing the distance between the mirrors the difference between two wavelengths can be determined.
6. [FresnelDiffraction.ipynb](./PhysicalOptics/FresnelDiffraction.ipynb) **Fresnel diffraction** from a round hole is studied by measuring on-axis minimum- and maximum intensities as a function of the hole diameter and distance from the hole.

## Geometric Optics
1. [resonator geometric optics.ipynb](./GeometricOptics/resonator_geometric_optics.ipynb) Description of a **stable resonator** using geometric optics.
