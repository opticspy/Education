# Education
Optics simulations using the LightPipes optical toolbox are written in Jupyter notebooks. Students can open the notebook, read some introduction about the topic and perform exercises. The simulations can be used as an introduction to real optical experiments in the lab.

The following notebooks are available:

1. [spherical_wavefront.ipynb](./spherical_wavefront.ipynb) A **spherical wavefront** is produced by illuminating a small hole with a monochromatic, plane wave. The student investigates the inverse quadratic law by measuring, with the mouse, the intensity at the centre of the beam at several distances from the hole. ![](./images/spherical_wavefront_sim.png)
2. [ReflectRefract.ipynb](./ReflectRefract.ipynb) **Internal reflection and refraction** is studied. A linear polarized laser beam enters a glass and is internally reflected and refracted. The polarization and the angle of incidence can be varied. ![](./images/reflect_refract_sim.png)
